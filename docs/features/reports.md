# Project Management

Project management is at the core of the SiteReports platform. This section explains how to effectively manage your AV installation projects.

## Project Structure

Each project in SiteReports is organized into several modular sections that can be customized based on your needs:

### 1. Project Overview

The central hub for your project containing:

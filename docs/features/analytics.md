# Asset Management

The Asset Management section of SiteReports provides powerful tools to help you track equipment throughout the AV installation process.

## Asset Tracking Workflow

SiteReports uses a structured workflow to track assets from initial inspection to final testing:

1. **Inspected at HQ**: Initial verification of equipment at headquarters
2. **Received at Site**: Confirmation of delivery to installation location
3. **Fitted**: Equipment has been installed in its final position
4. **Tested**: Final verification that the equipment is functioning properly

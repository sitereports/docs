## Troubleshooting

### My report is taking a long time to generate. Is this normal?

Report generation time depends on:
- The size and complexity of the website
- The number of pages being analyzed
- The type of report you're generating
- Current system load

Most reports complete within 5-15 minutes, but larger sites may take longer.

### Why are some pages on my site not being analyzed?

Pages might be skipped if they:
- Are blocked by robots.txt
- Require authentication that wasn't provided
- Are dynamically generated with JavaScript that our crawler couldn't execute
- Exceed your plan's page limit
- Have URLs that match exclusion patterns you've set

### How do I interpret the scores in my report?

Our scoring system uses a 0-100 scale:
- **90-100**: Excellent - Your site excels in this category
- **70-89**: Good - Your site performs well but has room for improvement
- **50-69**: Average - Several issues need attention
- **30-49**: Poor - Significant problems that require addressing
- **0-29**: Critical - Urgent issues that need immediate attention

Yes, you can export report data in CSV or JSON format for further analysis in other tools.
